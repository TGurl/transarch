Welcome to TransArch.

This is a simple ISO containing a few windowmanagers. I created
it for my own use and is not meant to be a distro that is updated
regularly. If you want to use it you are welcome to, but I will
not take any responsibily for any damages or loss of data that
occurs from using this ISO.

Using this ISO on your system(s) is totally on your own risk.

You can simply start an X environment by issuing `launch`

To install Arch on your system, I recomment `archinstall`

Have fun using TransArch!

Kisses,
TransGirl
